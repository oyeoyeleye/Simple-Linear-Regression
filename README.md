# Simple-Linear-Regression
### Linear Regression from scratch without using any libraries

The project is to build a Simple Linear Regression model without using any Python library or packages with hope on getting more practice on using Python. My model defines most of the functions we will like to compute when working on any Linear Regression problem like mean, variance, residual, score and RMSE. 

The goal is to create a model from scratch and compare it to similar models in terms of accuracy. This was compared to using gradient descent method and sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.
