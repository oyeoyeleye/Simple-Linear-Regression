# Simple-Linear-Regression
### Linear Regression from scratch without using any libraries

The project is to build a Simple Linear Regression model without using any Python library or packages with hope on getting more practice on using Python. My model defines most of the functions we will like to compute when working on any Linear Regression problem like mean, variance, residual, score and RMSE. The goal is to create a model from scratch similar to sklearn.linear_model and compare mine to similar models in terms of accuracy and speed.
